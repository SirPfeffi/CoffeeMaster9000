# Base platform

--> Raspberry Pi 4
--> ESP32?

## Screen/Display?

--> 7" IPS - Touchdisplay

--> Mini-OLED

## LEDs

--> dependent on choice of display, but status LEDs for quick visualization of operation probably very helpful (e.g. active RFID communication etc.)

## Audio

--> Piezo Buzzer

--> Mini Speaker with DAC/Mini-Amp

## Connectivity

### RFID

--> MFRC-522 via IÂ²C

### Wifi

--> Connect with suitable local Wifi for remote management & checking

### Connection with coffee machine?

Is this needed? If so, the coffee machine features a debug port with propietary protocol ;)
